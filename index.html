    <p>I want to stream sometime in the future, but my computer isn't suited for that type of stuff. Oh well.

        <p>I'm a pretty bad osu!standard player who can only play generic TV size farm maps. I'm trying to learn <br> how to be actually good at the game, but I just can't seem to make any progress.</p>

    <p>Oreos are pretty nice. Here's a list of some pretty good flavors. You should try them sometime!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Hot Cocoa</li>
        <li>- Watermelon</li>
        <li>- Cookie Dough</li>
        <li>- Original</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The catch is, you won't be able to try 75% of them because they were limited edition! After all, kettle corn oreos <br> are so much better! (/s)</p>
